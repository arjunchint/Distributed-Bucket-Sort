  - Evidence:
     - The text is not great at saying what I should be looking at in the
       figures: -0.25
     - They show the imbalance of workload from changing the quicksort
       pivot (figure 2): good
     - The testing of different combinations of pivot changes is good: it
       makes up somewhat for the lack of reasoning for the pivot changes
     - The evidence
  - Planning:
     - The deductive reasoning for why the changes in pivot choice locations
       is under-motivated: this was discussed in class, but why switch to 1/3?
     - The blame the load imbalance on the pivot, but the more obvious reason
       for the load imbalance in quicksort with an uneven number of processes
       is that, by default, one process must take the upper half of two other
       process's keys in the exchange: -0.25
     - The planning of using the improved space complexity of sample sort for
       big problems is good
     - The explanation for why Isend is better than Ssend is under-motivated:
       there is no opportunity for overlapping computation and communication
       within a call to swap_bitonic().  A better explanation for why Ssend
       would be slower than Isend is if a different protocol is used (rendezvous
       instead of eager) that is worse for smaller messages: -0.25
